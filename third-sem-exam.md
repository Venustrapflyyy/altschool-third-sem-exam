## TASK

- We deploy our microservices-based architecture on Kubernetes and we need to create a clear IaaC (Infrastructure as Code) deployment to be able to deploy our services in a fast manner.
 
## Setup Details
- Provision a webapp of your choosing with nginx/httpd frontend proxy and a database (mongo, postgresql etc) backend .
- Provision the Socks Shop example microservice application - https://microservices-demo.github.io/
 
## Task Instructions
- Everything needs to be deployed using an Infrastructure as Code approach.
- In your solution please emphasize readability, maintainability and DevOps methodologies. We expect a clear way to recreate your setup and will evaluate the project decisions on:
- Metrics
- Monitoring
- Logging

- Use Prometheus as a monitoring tool
- Use Ansible or Terraform as the configuration management tool.
- You can use an IaaS provider of your choice.
